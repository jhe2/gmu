1. Build Instructions

To compile Gmu you will need a build environment for the desired target.
Such an environment typically consists of a compiler and additional
libraries. It is called a 'tool chain'.
Gmu has been tested with GNU make and both GCC and clang, but other C
compilers should work as well. It should be possible to build and run
Gmu on any POSIX compliant system.

Gmu needs a few libraries:

Gmu core:
	- libSDL (SDL1.2 up to Gmu 0.10.X, SDL2 starting with Gmu 0.11.0)
	- libpthread
	- optional: sqlite3 (for the media library)

Gmu SDL frontend
	- libSDL (SDL1.2 up to Gmu 0.10.X, SDL2 starting with Gmu 0.11.0)
	- libSDL_image
	- libSDL_gfx (optional but highly recommended)

Additional libraries are required for the decoder plugins, e.g. the
Tremor library is required by the Ogg Vorbis decoder plugin and
libmpg123 is required by the MP3 decoder plugin.

Since Gmu 0.10.0 the build process has been simplified, by including a
configure script (not autotools based). With this script the previously
required manual creation of .mk config files (see below) is no longer
supported. The configure script tries to figure out which components are
available on the system and enables/disables optional parts of Gmu
accordingly. The configure script also understands a couple of command line
options for configuring various things manually.
Run ./configure --help for an overview of available options.
The syntax is similar to the typical autoconf based configure script.

Example:

To configure Gmu with the media library feature enabled and the ModPlug
decoder disabled, one could run the configure script like so:

$ ./configure --enable=medialib --disable=modplug-decoder

Most optional features are enabled automatically as soon as the configure
detects all necessary dependencies. The only exception is the media library
which is currently disabled, since it is not yet fully implemented. This
default will change as soon as the media library is usable from all
major frontends.
Sometimes you might want to disable certain features, even if you meet
all the requirements. For example you might want to disable some of the
module decoders, since they all support most module formats, but vary in
playback accuracy and CPU usage.

Besides the --enable and --disable flags, there are a couple of other flags
that can be used to tell configure where to find certain files or to
configure other settings:
--includes
	This can be used to specify additional include paths for header files.
--libs
	This can be used to specify additional library search paths.
--sdk-path
	This can be used to specify the tool chain's base directory.
--target-device
	This can be used to specify the desired target device. The target
	device selection is used to build Gmu with hardware specifig features.
	This usually includes things like display backlight control and audio
	mixer	settings. For a hardware target "dingux" the hardware specific
	code could be found in the src directory in hw_dingux.h and hw_dingux.c.
	If no target device is speficied, the default generic "unknown" target
	is used.

After a successful configure run Gmu can be built with make, e.g.:

$ make -j5

Another example (for building Gmu with the OpenWRT Zipit Z2 toolchain):

$ CFLAGS="-I/opt/openwrt-libs-includes_bleeding-edge/usr/include/ncursesw -I/opt/openwrt-libs-includes_bleeding-edge/usr/include/SDL -I/opt/openwrt-libs-includes_bleeding-edge/usr/include" \
LFLAGS="-L/opt/openwrt-libs-includes_bleeding-edge/lib -L/opt/openwrt-libs-includes_bleeding-edge/usr/lib" \
CC=arm-openwrt-linux-muslgnueabi-gcc ./configure \
--sdk-path=/opt/OpenWrt-Toolchain-pxa_gcc-5.3.0_musl-1.1.14_eabi.Linux-x86_64/toolchain-arm_xscale_gcc-5.3.0_musl-1.1.14_eabi/ \
--target-device=zipit-z2
$ make

Prior to Gmu 0.10.0 it was necessary to create an .mk config file manually
or use one of the included files for building for a specific target.


1.1 Makefile targets

There are some Makefile targets, that might be of interest.

1.1.1 Individual build targets (gmu.bin/gmuc/decoders/...)

To build Gmu's main binary only, you can do so by using the make target 'gmu':

$ make gmu.bin

To build the decoders only, you would use the 'decoders' target instead, or
when you want to build a specific decoder only, you would tell make to build
only that decoder, e.g. when you want to build the vorbis decoder only, you
would use 'decoders/vorbis.so' as your target.

1.1.2 install:

The install target installs Gmu on a system. It understands the 
environment variables DESTDIR and PREFIX. PREFIX should be used for
telling 'make' where Gmu should be installed on the target system. It is
usually set to something like "/usr" or "/usr/local".
DESTDIR on the other hand specifies a temporary location where the files
are actually copied to. When you just want to install Gmu on the system,
you do not need to set DESTDIR at all. If you, on the other hand, want
to create an installable package, you probably want to use it.

Example:

$ make DESTDIR=/tmp/foo PREFIX=/usr install

This will install Gmu as if it was installed under /usr, but actually
copy its files to /tmp/foo/usr.

1.1.3 distbin:

The distbin target can be used to create a zip file containing everything
that is needed to run Gmu. When extracting the zip file, Gmu can be run
from the directory contained in the zip file without any further 
installation. The distbin target is usually used for devices like the
GP2X, the GP2X Wiz or the Caanoo, where the user downoads programs as
zip files and just extracts them on his SD card.

1.1.4 dist:

The dist target creates a .tar.gz archive containing everything to build
Gmu from source.


2. Adding a new target

2.1 Hardware specific code

Depending on the device you are trying to run Gmu on, you might want to add
device specific code for screen/backlight control and/or the audio mixer
to control the volume with the device's hardware mixer. Both things are
optional and aren't needed for all devices.
You need to create two files hw_new_target.h and hw_new_target.c. These
files consist of hardware specific things. Again, the easiest way of creating
those files is copying them. Copy hw_unknown.h to hw_new_target.h and 
hw_unknown.c to hw_new_target.c. You can make adjustments to those files later,
if you want/need to.

That should be it. You should now be able to build Gmu to run on your new target
device. Of course hardware specific things, like the ability to turn of the
display do not work in that stage. For these things, you need to modify
the hw_new_target.c/h files. 
You probably also want to adjust the button mappings to match your new device.
This can be done through config files. You do not need to recompile Gmu for
changing the button configuration.

2.2 Static build

By default, Gmu's plugins are built as external loadable plugins. It is
also possible to build Gmu as one static binary with all plugins built-in.
This can be useful for platforms where you are unable to dynamically load
shared objects (e.g. if you are forced to statically link the binary due
to a very old userland like on the GP2X with the default firmware).
To compile statically run:

 make STATIC=1

This does not necessarily link external libraries statically, but makes
sure all of Gmu's plugin are compiled into the main binary. A full static
build requires support by the used toolchain and all external libraries
must be available as static versions (.a files on Linux).
